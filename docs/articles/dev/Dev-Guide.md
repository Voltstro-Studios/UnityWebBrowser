# Developer Guide

This section contains docs useful for developers who want to work on UWB's code.

> [!WARNING]
> This section will assume some prior knowledge on certain topics is already known:

To get going, see the [setup section](Setup.md).

When developing for UWB, it is highly recommended to develop using `UnityWebBrowser.UnityProject` provided in the repo. Other means of development will **NOT** be supported! Even if you are creating an external separate package for UWB, it is still recommended to develop using the provided project in the repo! We recommend this approach as the Unity project has all dependencies ready to go, all the tools, and proper projects setup for the code (both Engine and Core).
