# FAQ

Here are some common questions we get. As time goes on, and we get asked more common question, we will add them here.

**Q**: Does UWB support *x* web feature?

**A**: I don't know, does CEF support it? If so, then there is a good chance UWB does.

---

**Q**: Can *x* feature be added?

**A**: If it is in-line with this project's scope, then sure. If you *really* want a feature, and the idea of it has been approved to be in this project, then I suggest creating a PR.

**Q**: Does UWB support proprietary codecs?

**A**: The build of CEF that UWB uses DOES NOT come with proprietary codecs by default. You can however build CEF yourself with proprietary codecs included. Have fun doing that.
