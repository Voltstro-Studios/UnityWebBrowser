# Unity Web Browser Docs

Welcome to the Unity Web Browser (UWB) documentation site!

UWB is a package that allows displaying and interacting with the web from within Unity. These docs should hopefully get you up and going with UWB.

## Docs Guide

The docs are divided into two sections.

- [User](articles/user/Setup.md) - Docs containing information on **using** UWB.
- [Developers](articles/dev/Dev-Guide.md) - Docs containing information on **developing/contributing to** UWB.

If you are just starting, then checkout the [setup section](articles/user/Setup.md).
