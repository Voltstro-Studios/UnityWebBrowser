### CEF Engine

This projects were used as inspiration/how-to for the CEF Engine.

- [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/) - Underlying web engine.
- [CefGlue](https://gitlab.com/xiliumhq/chromiumembedded/cefglue) - C# wrapper.
- [CefUnitySample](https://github.com/aleab/cef-unity-sample) - CEF directly in Unity. Has crashing problems tho.
- [unity_browser](https://github.com/tunerok/unity_browser) - (Orginally by Vitaly Chashin) CEF working in Unity using IPC, but the project is in a messy state.
- [ChromiumGtk](https://github.com/lunixo/ChromiumGtk) - Linux stuff with CEF
